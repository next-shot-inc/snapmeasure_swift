        <h2>Interpretation Tools</h2>
        <p>
        Once a picture has been taken, the interpretation screen appears with its associated tools. The image is typically of higher resolution than the device screeen so you can zoom-in/zoom-out or pan with two fingers.
        You can go back to the main screen using the "Done" or "Cancel" buttons.
        <p>
        It is recommended to digitize while zoomed-in not only to be more precise with the interpretation but also to optimize the rendering of the image which is typically many times the resolution of the screen. 
        </p>
        Below are the different digitization tools:
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td valign="top"><img src="edit-32.png"/></td>
                <td><b>Draw/Edit mode</b>: Draw or edit a boundary (top, unconformity, fault) with one finger.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>&nbsp;</td>
                <td>
                    <table style="border-spacing: 5px">
                     <tr>
                      <td valign="top"><img src="select.png"/></td>
                      <td><b>Pick mode</b>: Select a line to edit it, change its name or color or type.</td>
                     </tr>
                     <tr>
                         <td valign="top"><img src="new_line.png"/></td>
                         <td><b>New line</b>: Create a new line (new name).</td>
                     </tr>
                     <tr>
                         <td valign="top"><img src="solidfill-off.png"/></td>
                         <td><b>Paint Layers</b>: Toggle on/off the coloring of the outcrop layers (The lines bounding the layers must touch the borders or other lines).</td>
                     </tr>
                     </table>
                </td>
            <tr>
                <td  valign="top"><img src="erase.png"/></td>
                <td><b>Erase mode</b>: Delete interpretation below (boundary, facies, text)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td  valign="top"><img src="measure.png"/></td>
                <td><b>Measure mode</b>: Measure distance between two points (once the scale is defined)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td valign="top"><img src="draw_ref.png"/></td>
                <td><b>Scale mode</b>: Define the real distance between two points and therefore the picture scale. Enter the reference size in the text field and draw a line of that same distance on the picture.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td valign="top"><img src="facies.png"/></td>
                <td><b>Facies mode</b>: Interpret the facies/sedimentary style of an interval. Create a column of facies interpretation (pseudo-well) by snapping to interval above. The first interval width will define the width of the column.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td valign="top"><img src="type.png"/></td>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td valign="top"><img src="dip_point.png"/></td>
                <td><b>Dip/Azimuth mode</b>: Measure dip/Azimuth with device and locate the measurement on the image. The point snapped to a given line will have the same color as the line. The apparent dip will be shown on the picture.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td valign="top"><img src="define_feature.png"/></td>
                <td><b>Define feature</b>: Measure height and width of a feature and define the feature type (channel, lobe, etc.). These will be used for computing features statistics.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
        To export interpretations inside a GOCAD model, use the "Save" button at the top
        and the export options will be available:
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td valign="top"><img src="message.png"/></td>
                <td><b>Mail</b>: Email the image and the interpretation in GOCAD format. The image will be embedded in a Voxet, facies columns in a Well curve, lines will be PLines, and dip/azimuth points will be VSets with a normal.
                    <br><b>Warning:</b>An image without a scale defined cannot be exported.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td valign="top"><img src="save.png"/></td>
                <td><b>Export</b>: Save the current interpretation in GOCAD format (as above). The image file and the GOCAD file can then be found in the Files app available since IOS 11.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
